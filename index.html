  <h2>Picture Tag</h2>
  <!-- The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources. The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute.

  They can contain all sorts of HTML elements; text, images, lists, other tables, etc.-->

  <!-- To add a border to a table, use the CSS border property. (See in style in the head section of the document) Remember to define borders for both the table and the table cells.

  <h2>HTML Lists</h2>
  <h3>Unordered List</h3>
  <!-- An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag. The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default: -->
  <ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ul> 

  <h3>Ordered List</h3>
  <!-- An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag. The list items will be marked with numbers by default: -->

    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ol> 

  <h3>Description List</h3>
  <!-- HTML also supports description lists. A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term. The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term: -->
  <dl>
    <dt>Coffee</dt>
    <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
    <dt>Milk</dt>
    <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
  </dl> 

  <h3>Nested Lists</h3>
  <!-- Lists can be nested (list inside list). Note: A list item (<li>) can contain a new list, and other HTML elements, like images and links, etc.-->
  <ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea

  <h3>Ordered List - the Type Attribute</h3>
  <!-- The type attribute of the <ol> tag, defines the type of the list item marker:
    type="1" 	The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)
    type="A" 	The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters
    type="a" 	The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters
    type="I" 	The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers
    type="i" 	The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers

  <h2>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h2>
  <!-- Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. There are two display values: block and inline. -->

  <h3>Block-level Elements</h3>
  <!-- A block-level element always starts on a new line. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not. The <div> element is a block-level element. -->
  <div>Hello, I am a div.</div>

  <!-- These are all the block-elements in HTML:

  <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
  <!-- An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.-->
  <span>I am a Span paragraph.</span> 

  <!-- Here are the inline elements in HTML:

  <var>

  -->

  <h3>The div Element</h3>
  <!-- The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements. The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content: -->
  <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
  </div> 

  <h3>The span Element</h3>
  <!-- The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text: -->
  <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>HTML class Attribute</h2>
  <!-- The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element. Multiple HTML elements can share the same class. -->

  <h3>Using the class Attribute</h3>
  <!-- The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name. In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section: -->
  <div class="city">
    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="city">
    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="city">
    <h2>Tokyo</h2>
    <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Multiple Classes</h3>
  <!-- HTML elements can belong to more than one class. To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified. -->
  <p class="city main">London</p>
  <p class="city">Paris</p>
  <p class="city">Tokyo</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>HTML id Attribute</h2>
  <!-- The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element. You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document. -->
  
  <h3>Using the id Attribute</h3>
  <!-- The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document. The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id. The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}. -->
  <h6 id="myHeader">My Header (With myHeader id)</h6>
    
  <h3>Difference between Class and ID</h3>
  <p>A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.</p>

  <h2>HTML IFrames</h2>
  <!-- An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
  The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. -->
  <iframe src="iframe.html" height="200" width="300" titel="IFrame Example"></iframe>

  <br>

  <!-- An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link. The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe: -->
  <iframe src="iframe.html" name="iframe_a" title="Iframe Link Example"></iframe>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="iframe_a">Click here and see what happens.</a></p>
