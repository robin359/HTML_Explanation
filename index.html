<!-- 
  Welcome to this HTMl Explanation File! In this file I want to show you all important elements, features and best practices of the HTML language. 
-->

<!-- 
  Words written inside these arrows are "comments". These words are not displayed in the webpage and have nothing to do with the behavior of the page. They are just comments that should help the reader of the code to understand the code better. I will use a lot of comments to describe what each element of this file is doing.
-->

<!-- Now let's start. Have fun learning HTML! -->

<!-- 
  The first step to do is the declaration of the Doctype. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly. It is always the first part of every HTML file. 
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- 
  After the declaration the actual HTML file begins. Every webpage begins with an <html> and ends with an </html> tag. These are called "open" and "closing" tags. All elements of the page are inside these two tags. The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document. lang="en" is an attribut and defines the language of the page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. Notice that the attribute is written inside of the <html> tag: 
-->
<html lang="en">

<!-- 
  Now we start to create our HTML page. The first element that is important is the <head> section of the page. inside the <head></head>, the meta informations that define the webpage are located. The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>. 
-->
<head>

  <!-- 
    The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but are used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services. 
  -->

  <!-- Define the character set used -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">

  <!-- Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

  <!-- Define keywords for search engines: -->
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, Elements, Tutorial">

  <!-- Define a description of your web page -->
  <meta name="description" content="HTML Explanation File">

  <!-- Define the author of a page -->
  <meta name="author" content="Robin Wahl">

  <!-- Refresh document every 90 seconds. (This meta is optional) -->
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="90">


  <!-- 
    The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets. 
  -->  
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

  <!-- 
    The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page. More to this in the CSS Explanation. 
  -->
  <style>
    body {background-color: powderblue;}
    h6   {color: blue;}
    blockquote   {color: red;}
    table, th, td {border: 1px solid black;}
    th {text-align: left;}
    table {border-spacing: 5px;}

    .city {
      background-color: tomato;
      color: white;
      border: 2px solid black;
      margin: 20px;
      padding: 20px;
    }

    .main {
      font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; 
      font-size: 66px
    }

    #myHeader {
      background-color: lightblue;
      color: black;
      padding: 40px;
      text-align: center;
    }
    </style>
  
  <!-- 
    The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. The <title> element is required in HTML documents! The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
    The <title> element:
    - defines a title in the browser toolbar
    - provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
    - displays a title for the page in search engine-results
    So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible! 
  -->
  <title>HTML Explanation File</title>

<!-- Closing Tag of the head section-->
</head>

<!-- 
  The <body> element defines the document's body. The body is what the user sees as webpage. All the elements that are inside the body are visible to the user. 
-->
<body>

  <!-- 
    HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 
  -->
  <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
  <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
  <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
  <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
  <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
  <h6>This is heading 6 - blue because of the style attribute in the head section</h6>

  <!-- 
    HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph. 
  -->
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph.</p> 

  <!-- 
    HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
  -->
  <p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

  <!-- 
    HTML links are defined with the <a> tag: The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. 
  -->
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
  <br>

  <!-- 
    HTML images are defined with the <img> tag. The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes. 
  -->
  <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="This is an alternate text. It is shown because the image could not be displayed." width="104" height="142">
  <br>

  <!-- 
    The path of an images in the src attribute can also be a folder. The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
  -->
  <img src="img/buy_high_sell_low.jpg" alt="Buy high sell low." >

  <!-- 
    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. Usually, you do style the elements in an external CSS file and not inline like this. 
  -->
  <p style="color:blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>

  <!-- 
    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element. 
  -->
  <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a parapgraph with title/tooltip.</p>

  <!-- 
    The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page. 
  -->
  <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
  <p>This is some text.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
  <p>This is some other text.</p>
  <hr> 

  <h2>Preformated Text</h2>
  <!-- 
    The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text. The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks. 
  -->
  <pre>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the sea.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
  </pre> 

  <hr>

  <h2>Special HTML Formatting Examples:</h2>
  <!-- 
    <b> - Bold text
    <strong> - Important text
    <i> - Italic text
    <em> - Emphasized text
    <mark> - Marked text
    <small> - Smaller text
    <del> - Deleted text
    <ins> - Inserted text
    <sub> - Subscript text
    <sup> - Superscript text
  -->
  <b>This text is bold.</b> 
  <strong>This text is important!</strong> 
  <i>This text is italic.</i> 
  <em>This text is emphasized.</em> 
  <small>This is some smaller text.</small>
  <p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>

  <h2>blockquote, q, abbr, address, cite, and bdo HTML elements.</h2>
  <!-- 
    The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source. Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
  -->
  <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
  <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
  For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
  The world's leading conservation organization,
  WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
  1.2 million members in the United States and
  close to 5 million globally. (This blockquote is red because of the styling in the head section.)
  </blockquote> 

  <!--The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation. Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.-->
  <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p> 

  <!-- 
    The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM" Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines. Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element
  -->
  <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p> 

  <!-- 
    The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article. The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc. The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element. 
  -->
  <address>
  Written by John Doe.<br>
  Visit us at:<br>
  Example.com<br>
  Box 564, Disneyland<br>
  USA
  </address> 
  
  <!-- 
    The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.). Note: A person's name is not the title of a work. The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.
  -->
  <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p> 

  <!-- BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override. The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:-->
  <bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>

  <h2>Links</h2>
  <!-- 
    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: An unvisited link is underlined and blue. A visited link is underlined and purple. An active link is underlined and red
  -->
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Normal link</a>
  <br> 

  <!-- 
    By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link. The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document. The target attribute can have one of the following values: 
    _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
    _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
    _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
    _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
  -->
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_self">This link opens in the same window/tab as it was clicked</a>
  <br> 
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">This link opens the document in a new window or tab</a> 
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_parent">This link opens the document in the parent frame</a> 
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_top">This link opens the document in the full body of the window</a> 

  <!-- Opens Absolute URL's-->
  <h3>Absolute URLs</h3>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
  <p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>
  
  <!-- Opens Relative URL's (a link to a page within the same website)-->
  <h3>Relative URLs</h3>
  <p><a href="second.html">Second Page</a></p>
  <p><a href="img/chakra.jpg">Picture in the Website Folder</a></p> 

  <!-- To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag: -->
  <a href="default.asp">
    <img src="img/buy_high_sell_low.jpg" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
  </a>
  <br>

  <!-- 
    Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email): 
  -->
  <a href="mailto:robin.wahl@protonmail.com">Send email</a> 
  <br>

  <!-- 
    To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code. JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button: 
  -->
  <button onclick="document.location='button.html'">Click here</button> 

  <!-- 
    Create a bookmark in HTML: First use the id attribute to create a bookmark. Then add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page. (You can also add a link to a bookmark on another page)
  -->
  <h3 id="C4">Bookmarks</h3>
  <a href="#C4">Jump to bookmark on this page</a> 
  <br>
  <a href="outside.html">Jump to outside bookmark</a>

  <hr>
  <h2>Image Maps</h2>
  <p>Click on the picture and see what happens!</p>
  <!-- 
    The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags. The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.
  -->
  <img src="img/workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

  <!-- 
    The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click. The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute. The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute.
  -->
  <map name="workmap">

    <!-- 
      You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:
      rect - defines a rectangular region
      circle - defines a circular region
      poly - defines a polygonal region
      default - defines the entire region
      The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.
    -->
    <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" onclick="alert('You clicked the Computer!')">
    <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" onclick="alert('You clicked the Phone!')">

    <!-- 
      To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle (337px and 300px). Then specify the radius of the circle (44px)
    -->
    <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" onclick="alert('You clicked the Coffee!')">
  </map> 

  <p>Click on the croissant!</p>
  <!-- 
    shape="poly" can be used to create any shape. It contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon). 
  -->
  <img src="img/frenchfood.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#croissant">

  <map name="croissant">
    <area shape="poly" coords="140,121,181,116,204,160,204,222,191,270,140,329,85,355,58,352,37,322,40,259,103,161,128,147" onclick="alert('You clicked the Croissant!')">

  <h2>Picture Tag</h2>
  <!-- 
    The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources. The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device. Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.
  -->
  <picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img/chakra.jpg">
    <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img/buy_high_sell_low.jpg">

  <hr>
  <h2>HTML Tables</h2>
  <p>This is a standard HTML table:</p>
  <!-- 
    HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns. The <table> tag defines an HTML table. Each table row is defined with a <tr> tag. Each table header is defined with a <th> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <td> tag. By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered. By default, the text in <td> elements are regular and left-aligned.
  -->
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Firstname</th>
      <th>Lastname</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Jill</td>
      <td>Smith</td>
      <td>50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Eve</td>
      <td>Jackson</td>
      <td>94</td>
    </tr>
  </table> 

  <!-- 
    Note: The <td> elements are the data containers of the table. They can contain all sorts of HTML elements; text, images, lists, other tables, etc.
  -->

  <!-- 
    To add a border to a table, use the CSS border property. (See in style in the head section of the document) Remember to define borders for both the table and the table cells.
  -->

  <br>
  <p>This table has a cell span in a column in it (Telephone):</p>

  <!-- To make a cell span more than one column, use the colspan attribute: -->
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th colspan="2">Telephone</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bill Gates</td>
      <td>55577854</td>
      <td>55577855</td>
    </tr>
  </table> 

  <br>
  <p>This table has a cell span in a row in it (Telephone):</p>

  <!-- To make a cell span more than one row, use the rowspan attribute: -->
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:</th>
      <td>Bill Gates</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2">Telephone:</th>

  <h2>HTML Lists</h2>
  <h3>Unordered List</h3>
  <!-- 
    An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag. The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default: 
  -->
  <ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ul> 

  <h3>Ordered List</h3>
  <!-- 
    An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag. The list items will be marked with numbers by default: 
  -->
  <ol>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ol> 

  <h3>Description List</h3>
  <!-- 
    HTML also supports description lists. A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term. The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term: 
  -->
  <dl>
    <dt>Coffee</dt>
    <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
    <dt>Milk</dt>
    <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
  </dl> 

  <h3>Nested Lists</h3>
  <!-- 
    Lists can be nested (list inside list). Note: A list item (<li>) can contain a new list, and other HTML elements, like images and links, etc.
  -->
  <ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea
      <ul>
        <li>Black tea</li>
        <li>Green tea</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ul> 

  <h3>Ordered List - the Type Attribute</h3>
  <!-- 
    The type attribute of the <ol> tag, defines the type of the list item marker:
    type="1" 	The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)
    type="A" 	The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters
    type="a" 	The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters
    type="I" 	The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers
    type="i" 	The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers 
  -->

  <h4>Numbers</h4>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ol> 

  <h4>Uppercase Letters</h4>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ol> 

  <h4>Lowercase Letters</h4>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>

  <h4>Lowercase Roman Numbers</h4>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ol> 
  
  <h4>Control List Counting</h4>
  <!-- 
    By default, an ordered list will start counting from 1. If you want to start counting from a specified number, you can use the start attribute: 
  -->
  <ol start="50">
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ol> 

  <h4>Ordered Lists can also be nested</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea
      <ol>
        <li>Black tea</li>
        <li>Green tea</li>

    </li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h2>
  <!-- 
    Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. There are two display values: block and inline. 
  -->

  <h3>Block-level Elements</h3>
  <!-- 
    A block-level element always starts on a new line. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not. The <div> element is a block-level element. 
  -->
  <div>Hello, I am a div.</div>

  <!-- 
    These are all the block-elements in HTML:
    <address>
    <article>
    <aside>
    <blockquote>
    <canvas>
    <dd>
    <div>
    <dl>
    <dt>
    <fieldset>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <form>
    <h1>-<h6>
    <header>
    <hr>

    <p>
    <pre>
    <section>
    <table>
    <tfoot>
    <ul>
    <video>

  -->

  <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
  <!-- 
    An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
  -->
  <span>I am a Span paragraph.</span> 

  <!-- 
    Here are the inline elements in HTML: 
    <a>
    <abbr>
    <acronym>
    <b>
    <bdo>
    <big>
    <br>
    <button>

    <textarea>
    <time>
    <tt>
    <var>
  -->

  <h3>The div Element</h3>
  <!-- 
    The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements. The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

  <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
  </div> 

  <h3>The span Element</h3>
  <!-- 
    The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text: 
  -->
  <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

  <h2>HTML class Attribute</h2>
  <!-- 
    The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element. Multiple HTML elements can share the same class. 
  -->

  <h3>Using the class Attribute</h3>
  <!-- 
    The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name. In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section: 
  -->
  <div class="city">
    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="city">
    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="city">
    <h2>Tokyo</h2>
    <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Multiple Classes</h3>
  <!-- 
    HTML elements can belong to more than one class. To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified. 
  -->
  <p class="city main">London</p>
  <p class="city">Paris</p>
  <p class="city">Tokyo</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>HTML id Attribute</h2>
  <!-- 
    The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element. You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document. 
  -->
  
  <h3>Using the id Attribute</h3>
  <!-- 
    The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document. The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id. The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}. 
  -->
  <h6 id="myHeader">My Header (With myHeader id)</h6>
    
  <h3>Difference between Class and ID</h3>
  <p>A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.</p>

  <h2>HTML IFrames</h2>
  <!-- 
    An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page. The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. 
  -->
  <iframe src="iframe.html" height="200" width="300" titel="IFrame Example"></iframe>

  <br>

  <!-- 
    An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link. The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe: 
  -->
  <iframe src="iframe.html" name="iframe_a" title="Iframe Link Example"></iframe>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="iframe_a">Click here and see what happens.</a></p>

  <h2>HTML Computer Code Elements</h2>
  <!-- HTML contains several elements for defining user input and computer code. -->

  <h3>HTML kbd For Keyboard Input</h3>
  <!-- 
    The HTML <kbd> element is used to define keyboard input. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font. 
  -->
  <p>Save the document by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd></p> 

  <h3>HTML samp for Program Output</h3>
  <!-- 
    The HTML <samp> element is used to define sample output from a computer program. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font. 
  -->
  <p>Message from my computer:</p>
  <p><samp>File not found.<br>Press F1 to continue</samp></p> 

  <h3>HTML code for Computer Code</h3>
  <!-- 
    The HTML <code> element  is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font. 
  -->
  <code>
    x = 5;
    y = 6;
    z = x + y;
  </code>

  <!-- 
    Notice that the <code> element does not preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks. To fix this, you can put the <code> element inside a <pre> element: 
  -->
  <pre>
    <code>
    x = 5;
    y = 6;
    z = x + y;
    </code>
  </pre> 

  <h3>HTML var for Variables</h3>
  <!-- 
    The HTML <var> element  is used to define a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. 
  -->
  <p>The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x <var>b</var> x <var>h</var>, where <var>b</var> is the base, and <var>h</var> is the vertical height.</p>

  <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
  <!-- 
    Some characters are reserved in HTML. If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags. Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

  <h2>HTML Forms</h2>
  <!-- An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing. -->

  <h3>The form, input and label Elements</h3>
  <!-- The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input -->
  <form>
    <!-- The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements. The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element. The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox. The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together. -->
    <label for="fname">The form element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.</label><br>
    <!-- The <input type="text"> defines a single-line input field for text input -->
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname">

  <h3>Radio Buttons, Checkboxes and Submit Buttons</h3>
  <!-- The <input type="radio"> defines a radio button. Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices.-->
  <form>
    <input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male">
    <label for="male">Male</label><br>
    <input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="female">
    <label for="female">Female</label><br>
    <input type="radio" id="other" name="gender" value="other">
    <label for="other">Other</label>
  </form> 

  <!-- 
    The <input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox. Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices.
  -->
  <form>
    <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">
    <label for="vehicle1"> I have a bike</label><br>
    <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle2" name="vehicle2" value="Car">
    <label for="vehicle2"> I have a car</label><br>
    <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat">
    <label for="vehicle3"> I have a boat</label>
  </form> 

  <!-- 
    The <input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler. The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data. The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute.
  -->
  <form action="action-page.js">
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form> 

  <!-- 
    Notice that each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted. If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.
  -->

  <h2>HTML Form Attributes</h2>
  <!-- This chapter describes the different attributes for the HTML <form> element -->
  
  <h3>The Action Attribute</h3>
  <!-- 
    The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button. In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:
  -->
  <form action="/action_page.js">
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form> 

  <p><b>Tip:</b> If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.</p>

  <h3>The Target Attribute</h3>
  <!-- 
    The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. The target attribute can have one of the following values 
  -->
  <table> 
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th style="width:20%">Value</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>  
      <tr>
        <td>_blank</td>
        <td>The response is displayed in a new window or tab</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>_self</td>
        <td>The response is displayed in the current window</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>_parent</td>
        <td>The response is displayed in the parent frame</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>_top</td>
        <td>The response is displayed in the full body of the window</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><i>framename</i></td>
        <td>The response is displayed in a named iframe</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <p>The default value is <code>_self</code> which means that the response will open in the current window.</p>

  <h3>The Method Attribute</h3>
  <!-- 
    The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data. The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post"). The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. 
  -->
  <form action="/action_page.js" method="get"> 
  <form action="/action_page.js" method="post">
    
  <pre>
    <b>Notes on GET:</b>

      Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
      NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
      The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
      Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
      GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

    <b>Notes on POST:</b>

      Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
      POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
      Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

  </pre>

  <b>Tip: </b>Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information!

  <h3>The Autocomplete Attribute</h3>
  <!-- 
    The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off. When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.
  -->
  <form action="/action_page.js" autocomplete="on"> 

  <h3>The Novalidate Attribute</h3>
  <!-- 
    The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted.
  -->
  <form action="/action_page.js" novalidate>
